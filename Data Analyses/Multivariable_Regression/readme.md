<p>Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>The number of rooms</p></li>
 <li><p>The distance to employment centres</p></li>
 <li><p>How rich or poor the area is</p></li>
 <li><p>How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Today you will:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><p>Analyse and explore the Boston house price data</p></li>
 <li><p>Split your data for training and testing</p></li>
 <li><p>Run a Multivariable Regression</p></li>
 <li><p>Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals</p></li>
 <li><p>Use data transformation to improve your model performance</p></li>
 <li><p>Use your model to estimate a property price</p></li>


<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Today you've learned </strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><p>How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's <code>.pairplot()</code>.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to run a multivariable regression.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to analyse and look for patterns in a model's residuals.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to improve a regression model using (a log)&nbsp;data transformation.</p></li>
 <li><p>How to specify your own values for various features and use your model to make a prediction.</p></li>
