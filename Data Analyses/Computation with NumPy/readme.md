<p>No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (<strong>Numerical Python</strong>). NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. Itâ€™s practically <strong>THE</strong> standard for working with numerical data in Python. The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves ðŸ˜®&nbsp;</p><img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_10-22-08-b0c1d1c029ea910a79ae216ff161c1c1.png">
<p>So far, weâ€™ve been using Pandas, which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything weâ€™ve been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.</p>
