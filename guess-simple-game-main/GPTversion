# In this implementation, the play_game function takes a difficulty argument and sets the number of attempts accordingly. 
# It generates a random number between 1 and 100, which the player needs to guess. 
# The player is given the number of attempts specified for the chosen difficulty level.
# For each attempt, the player enters their guess, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. 
# If the player wins, the game displays a winning message and returns. If the player loses, the game displays a losing message. 
# The main program takes input from the user for the difficulty level, and passes it to the play_game function to start the game.
