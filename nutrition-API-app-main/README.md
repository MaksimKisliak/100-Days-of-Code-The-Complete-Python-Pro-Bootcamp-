nutritionAPI

The code inputs the name of a physical exercise from the user and uses the information along with the user's gender, weight, height, and age to send a request to the Nutritionix API to retrieve information about the exercise. The API returns information about the exercise such as its name, duration, and number of calories burned. The code then formats the information as a dictionary and sends a request to a Sheety API to add the information to a spreadsheet as a new row. The final line outputs the response from the Sheety API.
