<p>The code is for a quiz application that provides a graphical interface for users to answer a series of questions. The code is divided into three main files: <code>question_model.py</code>, <code>quiz_brain.py</code>, and <code>ui.py</code>.</p>
<p><code>question_model.py</code> contains a single class, <code>Question</code>, which represents a single question and answer. The class has two attributes: <code>text</code>, which stores the question text, and <code>answer</code>, which stores the correct answer.</p>
<p><code>quiz_brain.py</code> contains the <code>QuizBrain</code> class, which manages the questions and scores for the quiz. The class has several methods, including <code>still_has_questions</code>, which returns <code>True</code> if there are still questions left to ask, and <code>check_answer</code>, which compares the user's answer with the correct answer and updates the score if necessary.</p>
<p><code>ui.py</code> contains the <code>QuizInterface</code> class, which provides the graphical interface for the quiz. The class uses <code>Tkinter</code> to create a window with several labels, buttons, and a canvas for displaying the questions. The class has several methods, including <code>get_next_question</code>, which retrieves the next question from the <code>QuizBrain</code> object and displays it on the canvas, and <code>give_feedback</code>, which provides feedback to the user based on their answer.</p>
