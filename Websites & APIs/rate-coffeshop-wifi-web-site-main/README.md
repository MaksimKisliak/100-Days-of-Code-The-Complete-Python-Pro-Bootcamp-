<p>The code uses the Flask web framework to create a web application for adding and displaying cafes. The application allows users to input data about a cafe, including its name, location on Google Maps, opening and closing times, and ratings for coffee, wifi, and power socket availability.</p>
<p>The code uses <code>FlaskForm</code> and other modules from the <code>wtforms</code> package to create the forms for inputting cafe data, and <code>Flask_bootstrap</code> is used to style the templates and forms.</p>
<p>The <code>add_cafe</code> route accepts GET and POST requests, and upon receiving valid form data, writes the data to a CSV file called <code>cafe-data.csv</code>. The application then redirects to the <code>/cafes</code> route to display the updated list of cafes. If the form data is not valid, the <code>add.html</code> template is rendered with the form data.</p>
<p>The <code>cafes</code> route simply opens the <code>cafe-data.csv</code> file and reads its contents, storing the rows in a list. The <code>cafes.html</code> template is then rendered, passing the list of rows as an argument.</p>
