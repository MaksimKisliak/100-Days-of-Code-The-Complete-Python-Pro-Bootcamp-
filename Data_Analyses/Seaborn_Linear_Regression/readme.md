<p>In this lesson, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib.&nbsp;</p><img align="middle" width="662" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-14_11-55-48-2c83542d09cb8d7e8c8dfc03616734f7.png" height="550">
<p>The question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Today you'll learn: </strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><p>How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn</p></li>
 <li><p>How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn</p></li>
 <li><p>How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data</p></li>
 <li><p>How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart</p></li>
 <li><p>How to cleverly use floor division <code>//</code> to convert your data</p></li>
</ul><img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-14_11-48-35-4f37a708b04a864a3fe1ab0b2138dd05.png">

<p>Today was a pretty packed lesson where we introduced a lot of new concepts. In this lesson we looked at how to:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns</p></li>
 <li><p>Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both <code>.loc[]</code> and <code>.query()</code></p></li>
 <li><p>Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library</p></li>
 <li><p>Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters</p></li>
 <li><p>Use floor division (i.e., integer division)&nbsp;to convert years to decades</p></li>
 <li><p>Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data</p></li>
 <li><p>Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric</p></li>
 <li><p>Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.</p></li>
</ul>
