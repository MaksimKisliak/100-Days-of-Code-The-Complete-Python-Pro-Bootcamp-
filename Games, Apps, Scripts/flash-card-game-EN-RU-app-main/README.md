<p>The app is a flash card game that displays words in English and their corresponding translations in another language (Russian, according to the code).</p>
<p>The game window is created using the tkinter library, and has a green (#B1DDC6) background color. The constants for the game, including the background color, fonts, and the time to count down, are defined at the beginning of the code.</p>
<p>The game uses a pandas dataframe (read from a csv file) to store the English words and their translations. A function named <code>sample</code> is defined to randomly sample a number of rows (the number is passed as an argument) from the dataframe. The sampled data is stored in a global variable named <code>random_set</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>count_down</code> function is used to display the English words from the <code>random_set</code> dataframe and count down from a given time (3 seconds in this case). The English words are displayed on the flash card canvas. Once the countdown reaches 0, the flash card canvas is flipped to show the translation, and the user is asked to mark whether they knew the answer or not using check mark and deny buttons (images).</p>
<p>If the user clicks the check mark button, the card is removed from the deck and not shown again. If the user clicks the deny button, the card is kept in the deck to be shown again later.</p>
<p>The user can start the game by clicking the on/off button, which calls the <code>sample</code> function to sample 100 words from the dictionary and start the game.</p>
<p>The flash card canvas consists of an image of a flash card, with the original language text ("English") and the English word text displayed on the front of the card, and the translation text displayed on the back. The timer text is also displayed on the front of the card.</p>
<p>The UI elements (buttons, canvas, and text) are arranged on a grid using the <code>grid</code> method.</p>
<p>Overall, this app is a simple flash card game that uses the pandas library to sample and display words from a dictionary. The app could be improved by allowing the user to select the language they want to learn, adding more functionality to the check mark and deny buttons, and using a more efficient algorithm to sample words from the dictionary.</p>
