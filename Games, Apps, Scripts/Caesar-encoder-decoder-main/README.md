<p>The Python script that scrapes a webpage for a list of movie titles, and then writes the list to a text file.</p>
<p>The script starts by importing the <code>json</code>, <code>requests</code>, and <code>BeautifulSoup</code> modules, which are used to handle the webpage data. It then defines the URL of the webpage it will scrape.</p>
<p>The script then creates a <code>BeautifulSoup</code> object from the webpage's HTML using <code>requests.get(url).content</code>. It then extracts the data from the webpage's JSON object using <code>json.loads(soup.select_one("#__NEXT_DATA__").contents[0])</code>.</p>
<p>The script defines a function <code>find_articles</code> that takes a dictionary or a list as an argument and recursively searches for articles in a nested data structure. It does this by looping through the key-value pairs in a dictionary or items in a list, checking if the key starts with "ImageMeta:", and yielding the title text of the article if it does. If the key does not start with "ImageMeta:", it recursively searches for articles in the value.</p>
<p>The script then writes the found articles to a text file if the block is uncommented, and reads the text file to print the articles in reverse order.</p>
<p>The second code block you provided is a Python script that performs the Caesar Cipher. It defines a function <code>caesar</code> that takes a string, a shift amount, and a cipher direction as arguments, and returns the shifted string. It loops through each character in the input string, shifting the character by the specified amount in the specified direction. It then prints the shifted string.</p>
<p>The script also has a <code>while</code> loop that asks the user whether they want to encode or decode a message, and then prompts them for the message and the shift amount. It then calls the <code>caesar</code> function with the specified arguments and prints the shifted message. The loop continues until the user chooses to stop.</p>
