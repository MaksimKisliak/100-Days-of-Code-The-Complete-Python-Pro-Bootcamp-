<p>The script is a Coffee Machine game written in Python. The game accepts inputs from the user to serve different kinds of coffee as specified in the MENU dictionary. The machine has predefined resources (in the <code>resources</code> dictionary) such as water, milk, coffee and money, and these are used to serve the different types of coffee.</p>
<p>The script contains several functions that help to serve coffee to the user. The <code>report()</code> function is responsible for printing the current status of the coffee machine resources. When the user enters “report” to the prompt, a report is generated that shows the current resource values.</p>
<p>The <code>check_transaction()</code> function checks whether the user has inserted enough money to purchase the selected coffee. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine offers the change. If the money inserted is not sufficient, then the machine returns the money to the user.</p>
<p>The <code>process_coins()</code> function is responsible for prompting the user to insert coins and calculates the monetary value of the coins inserted. The user is expected to insert quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.</p>
<p>The <code>check_resources()</code> function is responsible for checking if the coffee machine has enough resources to make the user's selected coffee. The function checks the availability of required ingredients for a specific coffee, and if they are not available, the function returns False.</p>
<p>The <code>make_coffee()</code> function deducts the specific amount of required ingredients for a particular type of coffee from the machine resources and outputs the coffee to the user.</p>
<p>The MENU dictionary contains three types of coffee, i.e., espresso, latte and cappuccino, each with a specified cost and the required ingredients. The resources dictionary contains four types of resources, i.e., water, milk, coffee, and money. These resources are used to serve the different types of coffee.</p>
<p>When the script is run, the user is prompted to select the type of coffee they would like to buy. If the user selects the "off" option, the script stops running. If the user selects a type of coffee, the script calls the <code>check_resources()</code> function to check if the coffee machine has the resources to make that type of coffee. If the machine has the resources, the <code>process_coins()</code> function is called to prompt the user to insert coins. The monetary value of the coins is calculated and stored in a variable, which is then passed to the <code>check_transaction()</code> function to check if the user has inserted enough money to purchase the selected coffee. If the transaction is successful, the <code>make_coffee()</code> function is called to make the user's selected coffee. Finally, the coffee is output to the user.</p>
