<p>This Python application is a timer that implements the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.</p>
<p>The application uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays a tomato image and a timer countdown. It also includes a start button and a reset button, as well as a label to display checkmarks for each work session completed.</p>
<p>The application defines several constants, including colors and font name, as well as the length of each work session, short break, and long break, in minutes.</p>
<p>The application uses several functions to implement the timer mechanism, countdown mechanism, and timer reset. The <code>start_timer</code> function increments the number of work sessions completed and starts the countdown for the next work session, short break, or long break, depending on the current session number. The <code>count_down</code> function updates the timer countdown every second and ends the current session when the countdown reaches zero. The <code>reset_timer</code> function cancels the current timer and resets the timer countdown, session number, and checkmarks.</p>
<p>The <code>UI SETUP</code> section sets up the graphical user interface, including the window title, padding, and background color. It also defines the timer label, the tomato image, the timer countdown, and the start, reset, and checkmark buttons.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>window.mainloop()</code> statement starts the GUI event loop, which waits for user input and updates the GUI as necessary.</p>
