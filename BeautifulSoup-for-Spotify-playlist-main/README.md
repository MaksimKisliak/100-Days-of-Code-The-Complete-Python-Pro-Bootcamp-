<p>Program Requirements:</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>Use BeautifulSoup/Requests to scrape all the listings from the Zillow web address (Step 4 above).</p></li>
 <li><p>Create a list of links for all the listings you scraped. e.g. <img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-44-03-cb3327d64e803a957cb15bc1f76a7bd4.png"></p></li>
 <li><p>Create a list of prices for all the listings you scraped. e.g.<img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-46-01-e6685011b9c0862037454140314a17b9.png"></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><p>Create a list of addresses for all the listings you scraped. e.g.</p><img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-46-59-18b592d30cf361e9ad9348e830b7bce6.png"></li>
 <li><p>Use Selenium to fill in the form you created (step 1,2,3 above). Each listing should have its price/address/link added to the form. You will need to fill in a new form for each new listing. e.g.</p><img align="middle" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-50-47-7e40268135497ea3e84762091f48779d.gif">
  <ul>
   <li><p>Once all the data has been filled in, click on the "Sheet" icon to create a Google Sheet from the responses to the Google Form. You should end up with a spreadsheet with all the details from the properties.</p></li>
  </ul></li>
