The <code>iss_tracker.py</code> script is a Python script that tracks the International Space Station's current location and sends an email notification when it is passing overhead and it is nighttime at the user's location. The script uses the <code>requests</code>, <code>datetime</code>, and <code>smtplib</code> modules to make HTTP requests to external APIs to get the ISS's current location and determine the user's local sunrise and sunset times.</p>
<p>The script has two main functions: <code>is_iss_overhead()</code> and <code>is_night()</code>. The <code>is_iss_overhead()</code> function uses the <code>requests</code> module to make an HTTP request to the Open Notify API to get the ISS's current latitude and longitude. The function then compares the ISS's coordinates to the user's coordinates to see if the ISS is within 5 degrees of the user's location. If the ISS is overhead, the function returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>is_night()</code> function uses the <code>requests</code> module to make an HTTP request to the Sunrise-Sunset API to get the user's local sunrise and sunset times. The function then uses the <code>datetime</code> module to get the current hour and compares it to the local sunrise and sunset times to see if it is currently nighttime. If it is nighttime, the function returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>The main part of the script uses a <code>while</code> loop that runs continuously every 60 seconds. The loop calls the <code>is_iss_overhead()</code> and <code>is_night()</code> functions to check if the ISS is overhead and it is currently nighttime. If both conditions are true, the script uses the <code>smtplib</code> module to send an email notification to the user's email address.</p>
<p>The user needs to replace the values for <code>MY_EMAIL</code>, <code>MY_PASSWORD</code>, <code>MY_LAT</code>, <code>MY_LONG</code>, and <code>__YOUR_SMTP_ADDRESS_HERE___</code> with their own email address and password, their latitude and longitude, and their SMTP server address to use the script.</p>
